# Bugs:

1. Sometimes on new boot the top drag-down menu doesn't work. Fixed by locking phone

2. Sometimes when wake from suspend? And if you manually turn off mobile data or mobile network, when turned on internet does not work (only cellular no data)?
After a while the setting option disappears, and reappear, probably restarting service, but still no internet.
2b. (related or not?) Usually you can force 2G/3G/4G instead of using default, but sometimes not with error: "Setting allowed modes not supported."

# Feature Questions/Requests

1. Import/export contacts from SIM card? (contacts can be handled via .vcf file instead)
2. How to get VoLTE to work, if it doesn't out of the box?
3. Add shortcut / key combination for screenshot?
4. Watch videos in browser without lag, HW acceleration?
5. Record videos at all? Have video calls?
6. Does GPS work? (TODO test me)
