# Note to self, todo

1. ~~Add carrier info from here to pine64 wiki~~ \
**Done**: https://wiki.pine64.org/index.php?title=PinePhone_Carrier_Support&diff=prev&oldid=14662
2. ~~Add carrier info and firmware versions from here to modem sdk (github) wiki~~ \
**Done**: https://github.com/the-modem-distro/pinephone_modem_sdk/pull/165/commits/afe48eee8d36f5315c10a99cd6a0f24637bb3457
3. ~~Try pinephone revision 1.2: does issues persist, and also how does it function as desktop computer e.g.~~ \
**Partial answer:** everything seems the same, except for some hw fixes (basically USB-C data now works). As a desktop computer should be ok if the graphics weren't so slow and USB-C gets angry sometimes after disconnecting cord. Fixable?
4. Report bugs? (see questions_and_bugs.md) -> e.g. here https://salsa.debian.org/Mobian-team
5. How the hell doesn't the wifi kill switch work? What is the wiring?
6. Upload pictures from cameras, how does it look?
