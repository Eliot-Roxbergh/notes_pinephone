# Note to self, todo

1. Add carrier info from here to pine64 wiki
2. Add carrier info and firmware versions from here to modem sdk (github) wiki
3. Try pinephone revision 1.2: does issues persist, and also how does it function as desktop computer e.g. \
**Partial answer:** everything seems the same, except for some hw fixes (basically USB-C data now works). As a desktop computer should be ok if the graphics weren't so slow and USB-C gets angry sometimes after disconnecting cord. Fixable?
5. Report bugs? (see questions_and_bugs.md)
6. How the hell doesn't the wifi kill switch work? What is the wiring?
7. Upload pictures from cameras, how does it look?
