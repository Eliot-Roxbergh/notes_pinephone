# What do I need to do to use PinePhone?

I recommend this, (steps are explained in README.md)

1. Modem: update firmware and get modem sdk. Without this VoLTE did not work for me. (Also more features, probably less energy used etc.)
2. Sound: ~~Sound was buggy for me, get PipeWire~~ I still have sound issues.
3. MMS: Get a carrier that has data APN same as mms APN. Then set mms APN in the sms app's settings.
4. Alarm: Get Birdie so alarms work in suspend (default app does not!).

## Extras

1. Signal-desktop is not officially available but can e.g. be built manually. It is not optimized for phone though. TODO improve?
2. Increase call volume from speakers, it is low.
3. Video decoding is kind of slow, install mpv and watch/stream locally.
4. Enable suspend while charging to charge much faster
